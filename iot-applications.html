      <h2>Activity 1</h2>
      <p>
        In this Activity, we did discussion on IOT applications in which main question
        were What is an IoT application, there examples and the main features that are needed.
        IoT application exhanges data with other devices over internet where hardware and software 
        interfaces to connect, collect and analyze massive amount of data and present the data to users.
      </p>

      <h2>Activity 2</h2>
      <p>
        In this Activity, we discussed about the smart building. In which we discussed what does make the building 
        a smart building for that we learn about what does smart mean, After that we discussed some smart buidling scenarios 
        and then what are the main features needed. Smart means Self-monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology which converts 
        the simple thing to smart thing for example smart building. It performs predefined functions upon detection of specific 
        input and then processes it which is also known as Sense-Think-Act Paradigm. Some scenarios for smart buildings are: Smart Security Systems, 
        Smart AC, Smart lights and Smart Attendance Systems etc.

      <h2>Activity 3</h2>
      <p>
        In the third Activity, we discussed about the control interface in which we discussed how all these features are interfaced. We also discussed the high 
        level features which refers to those features which are complex and require extensive hardware and software. Then we discussed about who are the users: which are 
        categorized in two types: <ol><li>Registered Members: Employees of corporatre, staff and security members</li><li>Unregistered members: Visitors of Buildings.</li></ol> 
        <p>Then we discussed about the parts that are needed which are IoT sensors, Microcontrollers and Microprocessors. </p>
